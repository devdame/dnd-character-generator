A character generator for edition 3.5 of Dungeons & Dragons.  A side project of mine that's very much still under construction.  Building it first as a command line app, then once the logic is built out will transition it to a web application.  Yeah, I know, there's no testing yet—livin' on the edge. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 

If you'd like to try out the bare-bones version as it grows, clone down the repo and run ```ruby runner.rb```.  Simple!
